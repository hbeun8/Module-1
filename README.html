The site provides details information on partners that provides E Cycles as Shared Mobility, where they operate, what types of vehicles they provide and cost.

<h1 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h1>
<p>The purpose of the project is to showcase the benefits of using E Cycles for daily commute to work, shows or to just cycle around. Whilst the users understand and acknowledge that using cycles is better for the plannet, they dont understand that it is also cheaper, quicker, safer and healthier. The users will also learn more about providers and their offering. Finally, the users will be able to plan their journey through the cycle routes and available e-cycles on route, so if you wish, you can get on the train station and use an Electric cyle parked nearby to the station to get you to your friends party, early. </p>

<h2>Business Goals:</h2>
