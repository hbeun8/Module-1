Purpose of the website: Eclectic Cycles is an online resource that provides information about renting electric cycles as a means of shared-mobility, like a bus or a train. The site also provides some information on partners that provides E-Cycles as Shared Mobility, where they operate, what types of vehicles they provide and cost.

**Catch-phrase**: Rent a shared E-Cycle for all your adventures. See how easy it is.

Over the shorter distance, shared E-Cycles has demonstrated itself to be more virtuous than mass public demonstration, by being quicker, more affordable, more flexible and with zero emissions it is also kinder to mother nature.

# 1\. Project Goals

The purpose of the project is to showcase the benefits of using E-Cycles for daily commute to work, shopping or to just cycle around. Whilst users understand and acknowledge that using cycles is better for the planet, our research shows they do not really understand that it is also cheaper, quicker, safer and healthier. This can be true in wide variety of scenarios, but not all. The users will learn in what scenarios this is true via the Journey Planner. They will also learn more about providers of shared E-Cycles and their offering. Finally, the users will be able to plan their journey through cycle-routes and coverage of e-cycles on route.

## Business Goals:

- Build brand/ introduce in the growing area of electric cycles and shared mobility.
- We are operating a Sky-Scanner type website, for shared electric cycles, where our partners will offer a small fee for the referral. This will be done through the Journey Planner.
- Inform users of the benefits of shared mobility systems and provide additional information so that users can start their journey sooner.
- Based on users choice, the user can then book their journey on our partners website.
- Build a community around the website, through the newsletter which they can signup to.

## User Goals:

Users can choose one of our partners who are spread across London to rent an E-Cycle for your next adventure. Why choose Electric Cycles?

- Get there quickly: Average user takes nearly 1 hour to commute to work. Get on a cycle and cut journey times by half.
- Safer Journey: With dedicated cycle lanes commuting in busy inner cities is not just faster, but also safer.
- Greener Planet: Take care of our planet and future generations by riding cycles.
- More Affordable: A monthly pass costs just GBP 60, less than half the cost of a zone 1-3 tube pass.

# 2\. UX

## Target audience

Cyclists, naturalists, green-campaigners, daily office commuters who use buses and trains, for example.

## User Requirements and Expectations

Based on sample based assessments, the users expect:

- One stop website for all shared mobility needs, for example commute to work or to a friends party using traditional public/shared transportation.
- Plan journeys using shared electric cycles, or along with traditional public transport services.
- Info on benefits of using shared electric cycles.
- Info on coverage of shared electric cycles in any given area.
- Based on the Journey Planners, the user can then book their journey on our partners website.
- Engagement on the frequent use of shared electric vehicles through the newsletter.
- Info on costs of using a shared electric vehicle.

## User Stories

This website was created based on feedback of commuters based in London who were not aware of all the benefits of shared electric cycles. This website is created to address the gap.

# 3\. Design

This section will address questions relating to design choices, colors, fonts, structure and wireframe.

Design Choice:The design choice is guided by two projects reviewed during Module 1 of Full Stack Boot Camp:  
1\. Love running  
2\. Love Rosie.

**Colors:** We used Coolers color template to generate the following pallet to ensure there is adequate color contrast.

![Eclectic Cycles](https://github.com/hbeun8/Module-1/assets/120073730/fc732b6b-6ff5-4725-8efc-adce0ebbe08c)

**Fonts:** We have used Robeto and Xo sourced from Google Fonts. We used global inherited size for h1, h2 and h3 and p mostly. We used additional weights

**Structure:** We have used the concept of containers to organize the layout. Each container called row is created under each section and within each section we have created a number of columns. The column width is based on Flex to ensure visibility is based on viewport width. This ensures mobile responsiveness.

**Wireframe:** We created a wireframe of the website using Balsamiq online tool.

<img width="300" alt="Wireframe" src="https://github.com/hbeun8/Module-1/assets/120073730/47dc8036-4d4e-441f-9e44-c35ca2751811">
<br>
Other Stylistic Considerations

- Hero Image - Man riding the cycle
- Font Family - Exo, Robeto.
- Display is Flex
- Navbar: Padding is 2% 4%
- Nav Links: text align= right, flex = 1
- Nav Links UL LI: List-style = none, display = inline block, padding = 8px, 12px, position = relative.
- Logo: Border 2PX, Red, Solid, Opacity: 0.9%

# 4\. Technology Used

Languages: HTML/CSS  
Framework and Tools: Visual Studio, Github, Notepad, Paint, Canva, Google maps api.

# 5\. Features

1.  ## Landing Page

    This video shows the features of the Landing Page, which includes responsive design of navigation bar and buttons. The website is mobile friendly too.

2.  ## Cover Image
![Hero-image1](https://github.com/hbeun8/Module-1/assets/120073730/5cead626-9922-44fd-8fc5-d053d7bbe178)

    The image shows a man riding a Shared Electric Cyle. The choice of image was based on UX principles. The image speaks to freedom,i.e. freedom from hassle, delay, traffic, polution, etc... In other words, it addresses the problem with traditional forms of mass public transportation.  

3.  ## Navigation/ Toggle Menu
<img width="300" alt="Screenshot 2023-12-01 113326" src="https://github.com/hbeun8/Module-1/assets/120073730/ef11f95d-4a03-4c1d-b70a-ce7edf723660"><img width="150" alt="Screenshot 2023-12-01 113813 M" src="https://github.com/hbeun8/Module-1/assets/120073730/90790a45-c8b6-44c4-8d79-8f60f634562d">

These images show the mobile friendly and responsive navigation bar, for Desktop and Mobile views.


5.  ## Landing Page and Navigation Bar font size is relative

    The text/ font size is based on viewport width (i.e. "vw"), ensuring accessibility and ease in mobile and desktop views, i.e the size of font changes with viewport width.

6.  ## Landing Page Button Size is relative

    The text and button size is also based on viewport width (i.e. "vw"), this ensures the size approriateness for mobile and desktop views, , i.e the size of font changes with viewport width.

7.  ## Partners Page - Container has a Hover feature, Image size is responsive and External Links open in a separate browser.

    This section provides information about Partners. You will notice each partner has hover feature so it glows when the pointer appears over it. Further an embeded image, which has responsive size, also provides some context about the cycles they provide.<br>

    Also, provides users with a summary of each particpants offering.

    Furthermore, it provides users with a summary of where the participants home territory is.

11. ## Footer section with Contact Us, Form to Signup and QR Code

    Please note, there is a bug in the code, as the section is not vertically aligning. This is in the desktop view. We have used Flex-basis: 33% and vertical-align: top. However, this is not a problem in Mobile view.

Desktop View:

13. ## Bookings/ Plan your Journey Page.

    This is a demo/static page. The idea of this page is that users will be able to plan their journey/ get information on the cost and time it takes to travel through diverse mix of mass public transportation.<br>

    Furthermore, through an embeded google maps link, user can see what bikes are available in the area giving great choice.<br>

    The pages used Bootsrap components. \[Bootstrap\](https://mdboostrap.com/)
