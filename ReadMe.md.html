<h1><u>Module 1 - Assessment</u></h1> 
<h2>Developer: Varun Gupta</h2>
<p>This is the ReadMe.md for the project below. The main purpose of this document is to provide evidence of the work performed to meet the Module 1 Assessment criterias. </p>

<h2>Project name: Eclectic* Cycles</h1> 
<img src="" alt="Reposive Website">

(https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://saba-baroughi.github.io/Final-Project-CI/)
<p> <u>Purpose of the website:</u> Eclectic Cycles is an online resource that provides information on how users can learn about renting electric cycles as a means of shared-mobile, like a bus or a train. The site provides details information on partners that provides E Cycles as Shared Mobility, where they operate, what types of vehicles they provide and cost. While most providers charge based on usage per minute, the site also provides information on types of subscription based plan provided by our partners, which makes usage cheaper.  
</p>
<p><u>Catchphrase</u>: Rent a shared E-Cycle for all your adventures. See how easy it is.</p> 
</p>
<p>Over the shorter distance, shared E-Cycles has demonstrated itself to be more virtuous than mass public demonstration, by being quicker, more affordable, more flexible and with zero emissions it is also kinder to mother nature.

<h1 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h1>
<p>The purpose of the project is to showcase the benefits of using E Cycles for daily commute to work, shows or to just cycle around. Whilst the users understand and acknowledge that using cycles is better for the plannet, they dont understand that it is also cheaper, quicker, safer and healthier. The users will also learn more about providers and their offering. Finally, the users will be able to plan their journey through the cycle routes and available e-cycles on route, so if you wish, you can get on the train station and use an Electric cyle parked nearby to the station to get you to your friends party, early. </p>

<h2>Business Goals:</h2>
<ul> 
    <li>Build brand/ introduce in the growing area of electric cycles and shared mobility.</li>
    <li>We are operating a skyscanner type website, for shared electic cycles, where our partners will offer a small fee for the referral.</li>
    <li>Inform users of the benefits and providers of shared mobility systems and provide adtional information so that users can start their journey sooner.</li>
    <li>Based on users choice, the user can then book their journey on our partners webiste.</li> 
    <li>Build a communite around the website, through the newsletter.</li> 
    <li>Engage users so that they can share their experience through the blog.</li>   
</ul>

<h2>User Goals:</h2>

</ul>

<h1 id="ux">UX</h1>

</p>
<h1 id="design">Design</h1>
<p>This section will address questions relating to design choices, colors, fonts, structure and wireframe.</p> 
<p>
<u>Design Choice</u>: The design choice is guided by two projects reviewed during Module 1 of Full Stack Boot Camp:
<br>1. Love running
<br>2. Love Rosie.
<p><u>Colors</u>We used Coolers color template to generate the following pallete to ensure there is adequate color contrat.</p>
<img width=300 src="Assets\Images\Eclectic Cycles.png" alt="Coolers Color Pallete to ensure accessibility">
<p><u>Fonts:</u> We have used Robeto and Xo sourced from Google Fonts. We used global inherited size for h1, h2 and h3 and p mostly. We used additional weights</u></p>
<p><u>Structure:</u> We have used the concept of containers to organize the layout. Each container called row is created under each section and within each section we have created a number of coloumns. The column width is based on Flex to ensure visibility is based on viewport width. This ensures mobile responsivness.</p>
<p><u>Wireframe:</u> We created a wireframe of the website using Balsamiq online tool.</p>
<img width=300 src="Assets\Images\Wireframe.png" alt="website wireframe">
<h1 id="tech">Technology Used</h1>
<p><u>Languages:</u>HTML/CSS
<br><u>Framework and Tools:</u>Visual Studio, Github, Notepad, Paint, Canva, Google maps api.

## Fixed Bugs

I received a warning about changing image formats to WebP to improve accessibility, according to Lighthouse in DevTools. Although I made the changes, it did not increase the accessibility percentage.

## Unfixed Bugs



## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
The live link can be found here - (https://tbc]

## Content

Instructions on how to validate was taken from [Code Institute](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/)
The icons in the body were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
The map in the body was taken from [Bootstrap](https://mdboostrap.com/)

## Stylistic Considerations
-> Hero Image - Man riding the cycle.
-> Font Family - Exo, Robeto.
-> Font
-> Display is Flex.
-> Navbar: Padding is 2% 4%
-> Nav Links: text align= right, flex = 1
-> Nav Links UL LI: List-style = none, display = inline block, padding = 8px, 12px, position = relative.
->
-> Logo: Border 2PX, Red, Solid, Opacity: 0.9%
